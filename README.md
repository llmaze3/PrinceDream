# PrinceDream
In this game the main character, son of a king, has been confronted by this father. His father expressed his concerns about his son's mental strength. The main character goes to sleep and has a dream that prevents him from waking up until he learns to believe in himself. These are the scripts I used. Everything is in c#.
